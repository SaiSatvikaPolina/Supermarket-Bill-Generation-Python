## 📌 Conclusion

This project was created as a simple **Python mini-project** for learning purposes.  
It helped me understand the basics of **loops, dictionaries, conditionals, and formatted output**.  
I plan to improve it in the future by adding more items, saving bills to a file, and maybe even a small GUI.
